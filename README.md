# Ready-challenge

I've updated the Dockerfile with some improvements:
* Uses a specific Node.js version for consistency.
* Separates copying of the package.json file and running npm install for better caching
* Utilizes the smaller node:12.18.3-alpine image for the second stage.
* Uses the COPY command instead of ADD for simplicity.
* Adds a non-root user for security.
* Specifies the default command to start the Node.js application.

## Architectural Design/Assumptions:
This web service is stateless, allowing horizontal scaling.
AWS is the cloud provider.
Amazon ECS is chosen for container orchestration.
AWS ALB is used for load balancing.

## Components:
Application Load Balancer (ALB):

Distributes incoming traffic across multiple ECS instances.
Supports SSL termination for secure communication.
Provides a public endpoint for the service.

ECS Cluster:
Hosts the Docker containers.
Scales dynamically based on demand using Auto Scaling Groups.

ECS Service:
Manages the deployment and scaling of containers.
Ensures that the specified number of tasks (containers) are running.

Docker Container:
Hosts the web-based service with the core logic for the API layer.

### Notes:
Security:
Use Security Groups and Network ACLs to control traffic.
Could implement AWS WAF for additional protection against exploits.

Scaling:
Use ECS Auto Scaling policies to dynamically adjust the number of tasks based on demand.

High Availability:
Deploy ECS tasks across multiple Availability Zones for high availability.

Periodic Updates:
Implement a blue-green deployment strategy for minimal downtime during updates.
