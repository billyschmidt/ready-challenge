# Ready-challenge

* I've updated the Dockerfile with some improvements:
* Uses a specific Node.js version for consistency.
* Separates copying of the package.json file and running npm install for better caching during the build process.
* Utilizes the smaller node:12.18.3-alpine image for the second stage.
* Uses the COPY command instead of ADD for simplicity.
* Adds a non-root user (node) for enhanced security.
* Specifies the default command to start the Node.js application.

## Architectural Design/Assumptions:
The web-based service is stateless, allowing horizontal scaling.
AWS is used as the cloud provider.
Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is chosen for container orchestration.
AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) is used for load balancing and distribution of incoming traffic.

## Components:
Application Load Balancer (ALB):

Distributes incoming traffic across multiple ECS instances.
Supports SSL termination for secure communication.
Provides a public endpoint for the service.

ECS Cluster:
Hosts the Docker containers.
Scales dynamically based on demand using Auto Scaling Groups.

ECS Service:
Manages the deployment and scaling of containers.
Ensures that the specified number of tasks (containers) are running.

Docker Container:
Hosts the web-based service with the core logic for the API layer.

### Notes:
Security:
Use Security Groups and Network ACLs to control traffic.
Implement AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) for additional protection against web exploits.

Scaling:
Utilize ECS Auto Scaling policies to dynamically adjust the number of tasks based on demand.

High Availability:
Deploy ECS tasks across multiple Availability Zones for high availability.

Periodic Updates:
Implement a blue-green deployment strategy for minimal downtime during updates.
